# Feature unification regression fixtures

Each consumer crate depends on one backend release and enables only its matching
`lazymatrix` adapter. The harness depends on multiple consumers as ordinary
optional dependencies, so Cargo unifies their adapter features in one build.
Consumers check normalization and allocating and reusable forward and transpose
products with their own backend types.

Run the harness with, for example:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path tests/feature_unification/Cargo.toml --locked \
  --features ndarray_v0_16,ndarray_v0_17
```

`scripts/test-backends.sh coexistence` covers every version pair, both with and
without parallelism, and all supported releases together. MSRV checks exclude
nalgebra 0.35. The separate lockfile starts from the root lockfile's dependency
versions; update both deliberately when changing supported releases.
